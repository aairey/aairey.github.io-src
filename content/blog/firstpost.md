Summary: First Post to this blog

So, my first post on this blog.

Let's not make any promises here, but a frequency of one post a month would already be high above my expectations of myself. :)

As some may know I've tried a few other blogs but gave up on writing.
Let's see where this takes us ...

I chose pelican as a static site generator because it uses Python.
I preferred this over Jekyll's Ruby for example.

If you're interested in my setup, I basicly did something similar to [this](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/).

That's all for now.
See you around!
